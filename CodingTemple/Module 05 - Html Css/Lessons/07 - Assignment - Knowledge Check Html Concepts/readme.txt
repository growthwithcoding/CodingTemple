Module 1 HTML Assignment
Author: Austin Carlson

Overview:
This assignment demonstrates my understanding of core HTML elements covered in the first module of the Coding Temple Software Engineering Bootcamp. It includes a complete webpage structure with a navigation bar, contact form, product table, and images.

Key Components:

1. HTML5 Structure
- Semantic elements like <nav>, <form>, <table>, <section>, and <footer> are used for clear organization.

2. Navigation Bar
- Positioned at the top of the page with links to Home, About, and Contact.
- Styled to stretch across the page using Flexbox.

3. Contact Form
- Includes name, email, and message fields.
- Submit button is aligned to the right for visual polish.
- Bonus: Added a radio button group with humorous labels for "How did you find us?" while keeping the backend values clean.
- Centered radio group using inline styling.

4. Table Structure
- Displays three Coding Temple programs with columns for Program Name, Price, and Quantity (as required).
- Added Duration/Format column as a bonus to reflect realistic course details.

5. Images
- Two placeholder images included.
- One of them uses inline styling to add a rounded border for the bonus.

6. CSS
- Most styling is handled in a separate CSS file for cleanliness.
- A few inline styles are used intentionally to show how to style CSS inline.
- A consistent green highlight color (#00c4a7) is used throughout the site.

7. Personalization
- Includes a commented author tag in the <head>.
- Commenting throughout reflects my learning process and keeps the code fun but clear.

How to Use:
Open index.html in any modern browser. Styles are linked via style.css. No external assets required beyond internet access for the placeholder images.
